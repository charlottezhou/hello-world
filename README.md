# hello-world
the first try of coding!!! so excited!!!

Hi humans!
This is charlotte. I'm leanrning how to code. 

Yesterday I learnt how to drive but I was freaked out, because I didn't know how a car works and what my action would cause. For me, it is important to undertand "why" while i learn "how".

Maybe that works for coding as well.
