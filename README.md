# hello-world
the first try of coding!!! so excited!!!
Hi humans!
this is charlotte. I'm 23 years old now. 

yesterday i learnt how to drive but i was freaked out, because i didn't know how a car works and what my action would cause. for me, it is important to undertand "why" while i learn "how".

maybe that works for coding as well.
